# Python-Scripts
A collection of Python Scripts for the extremely popular Ultima Online.

# Treasure Hunter
 -This is an experimental treasure hunter script. 
## Install instructions:
 1. Download both treasure_hunter.py and treasure_hunter_dict.py  
 2. Load both files into Razor Enhanced  
 3. You only need to run "treasure_hunter.py".  
The other file is a dictionary file with all the points (split up because the dictionary has over 3000 entries)  

  
  ## Features
   -  Auto-find the closest 2 rune points, reports the point and distance.
   -  Highlights the benches that contain the book you need to open.
   -  Tells you with player.headmessage what rune you need to travel to.
   -  Tracking arrow towards treasure will show when you travel to the facet.
   -  CUO map will set a waypoint to the treasure.
   -  Auto-Dig, pick, disarm the chest when you are in range
   -  Uses Lootmaster to loot the chest.
## Planned Features
   - Would like to use MeesaJarJar's fake item spawner to mark the specific spot.
   - Add more point calculations based on certain filters.
   - Some way to highlight rune in the book (idk if this is possible)
   - Some way to differentiate between islands and land mass. (idk if this is possible)
## Known Issues
   - There is a very west island in Tokuno that doesnt have a rune and it makes me sad.
   - Script sometimes does not reset the benches.
   - The auto-dig,pick,disarm seems like it could be better and stop spamming.
   - Sometimes, when looting if you walk away the script error's out.
   - ~~The GUI is depressing.~~ Not anymore its not!
   - Dictionary is included in the python script... Probably bad.
   - The tracking arrow is off in facets other than fel and tram. Don't know why.


I welcome any changes/fixes/improvements from anyone else!
