atlas_decoder.py
 - Scans a runic atlas and output a csv file. It sometimes messes up, probably needs some error correction.

atlaswaypoints.csv
 - Converted original ouput to a more usable format. Possibly we can skip the conversion and just have it output this.

test12345.csv
 - Original output from the atlas_decoder.
